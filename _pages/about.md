I am a second year PhD student at INRIA and ENS in Paris, under the supervision of [Umut Simsekli](https://www.di.ens.fr/umut.simsekli/publications/). before that I studied at Ecole Polytechnique (Paris, France) and EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland).

My research focuses on learning theory and probability theory, in particular generalization bounds for neural networks.
